# Connected gloves

## The project

There are 466 million deaf people in the world. Moreover, since learning a written language when you don’t have the benefit of hearing is considerably harder, 80% of these people worldwide are illiterate or semi-illiterate which creates a barrier between them and others.

We are a team of five students at *CentraleSupélec* working on a project tackling this issue. The goal of this project is to create **a pair of gloves able to translate sign language into speech**.

Several attempts at solving this problem have been made in the past. For instance, the *MIT* created a prototype very close to what we are aiming for, however the data processing is not embeded in their gloves and an external computer is required for the translation. Other gloves exist but they are very expensive. We would like to reduce the costs significantly without impacting the performance of the device.
